- Each PRD must include:
  - A short feature summary
  - Detailed **user stories**
  - **Acceptance criteria** for each story
- If requirements are unclear, **ask clarifying questions** before drafting.  
- Save the PRD in the `docs/` directory as a Markdown file:
  - Filename must be **kebab-case** ending with `-prd.md` (e.g., `docs/save-data-prd.md`).
