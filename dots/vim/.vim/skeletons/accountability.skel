A popular activity is to post a weekly todo list, then edit progress as items are checked-off.

Week of **June 18**```
`---`
`[ ]` your tasks
`[ ]` more task(s)
`[ ]` `MON` go to grocery store
`---`

# BASIC task codes:

[ ] pending/planned
[%] some percentage done
[~] in-progress right now (deprecated because hard to see)
[*] in-progress right now (2019 version)
[?] stalled (by lack of info)
[.] paused (by me)
[:] blocked (by external conditions)
[X] done
[+] added+done
[>] bumped/deferred to next week
[-] removed
[/] failed

# Here are my SPECIAL CASE task codes:

[ ] MON task (scheduled for Monday)
[X] MON task (scheduled and completed on Monday as planned)
[X] MON task TUE (scheduled for Monday, but completed Tuesday)
[ ] task x5 (task should be repeated 5 times)
[2] task x5 (task was repeated twice so far)
[5] task x5 (task was successful)
{ } optional stretch/would-be-nice task
!!! MON uh-oh it's a late task (not yet started)
!X! MON late task TUE (late task, completed)
/// remember this

# Also, there typically are three sections, listed in order of priority:

[X] most-important task for week
[ ] most-important task for week
...
[X] important project task (sometimes scheduled)
[X] important project task (sometimes scheduled)
...
[ ] MON scheduled task/obligation
[ ] TUE scheduled task/obligation
